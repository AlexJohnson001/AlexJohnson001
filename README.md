## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I'm Alex Johnson, a full-stack software engineer with 10+ years of experience building scalable, open-source web applications. I specialize in TypeScript, Node.js, and cloud-native architectures.

Iâ€™m passionate about contributing to open-source projects that make development faster, more secure, and more accessible. I maintain several popular NPM packages, contribute to open-source frameworks, and write in-depth technical tutorials for the community.
